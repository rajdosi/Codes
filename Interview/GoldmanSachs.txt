Instructions to candidate.
  1) Run this code in the REPL to observe its behaviour. The
   execution entry point is main.
  2) Consider adding some additional tests in doTestsPass().
  3) Implement getLowestPrices() correctly.
  4) If time permits, some possible follow-ups.

Question: 
A popular online retailer allows vendors to specify different prices in advance 
for the same item throughout the day. We now need to design an algorithm that 
helps identify the lowest price for the item at any point of the day.
      
Assumptions:
1) For the algorithm, assume all vendors are selling the same product
and there is only one product being sold. Given a list that has
vendor information - ( startTime, endTime, price ) of the deal,
return a sorted list with different possible intervals and 
the least price of the product during the interval.

2) The interval is inclusive of start and end time. 

3) All the 3 values passed by the vendor are integers.
