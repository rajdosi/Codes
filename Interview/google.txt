Sample questions..

Questions 1 - Suppose I have a bunch of coins in my pocket, which we can represent as an array like so :

[1,5,10]

What are the unique sums of money that I might get if I just randomly grab some coins from my pocket.



Questions 2 - Return the count of the most popular element in the given non-empty int[ ]

Array is not necessarily sorted. may not alter input array, but if needed may allocate new memory.

Examples:

MaxCount ({7,7,8,8,9}) is 2
MaxCount ({7,7,8,8, 8,9}) is 3
MaxCount ({7, 8, 9, 8,7,7}) is 3
MaxCount ({7,7,7}) is 3


Questions 3- You're working on a project and you noticed that there has been a performance decrease between two releases. You have a function :
Boolean worseCommit 
( int commit1, int commit 2)

That runs performance tests and returns true if commit2 is worse that commit1 and false otherwise.

Find all of the bad commits that have decreased the performance between releases.

Assume no improvement in performance.

Example : 

     1 2 3 4 5
      ^.          ^
1 2 3 4 5| 1 2 3 4 5
^.    ^.              ^.    ^
1 2 3 4 5| 1 2 3 4 5
    ^  ^.                ^ ^
1 2 3 4 5
      ^

Could be 1....1 E10


Questions 4 - 

You got a list of floats, output a unique list of floats. Floats number are considered equal iff  |a-b|<precision (e.g.a=1.01, b=1.00, precision= 0.1).

Questions 5-part  (a)

You got a matrix of size n*m filled with 0s and 1s, suggest if there is a way to go from the top most row to the bottom most row.

You can not travel cells containing 0 and from a given cell you can only move in Up, Down, Left and Right direction.

Question 5 Part (b) :

Find out one of the paths ( any path)

Question 5 Part (c) :

Find out the shortest path, if the matrix consist of non - negative numbers denoting the cost of passing via that cell, and you can't pass through cells containing 0.

**********

There is a machine which we want to run different programs on according to a schedule ( start time and execution duration) everyday. Wr want to check if a new program can be added to the schedule on the same Machine.

Initial Problem :

Only 1 program can be running at any given time..

Example :

Already Scheduled P1 (10,5) , P2(25,15)

Start time > 10, Duration : 5

New Program (18,7) >can schedule , st:18, et:25

New Program (12,10)> can't schedule; st: 12, et: 22 ( conflicts with P1)

**********

 DP: Can not be restricted to a few examples, interviewer can ask anything. General understanding of how to use DP is more important than doing some questions. 

Game theory: winning position/best outcome in DPs. 


Binary Search: identifying use cases of binary search in case of problems involving a monotonic sequence/equation. 

Graph: Topological Sort, Connected components, May be coloring/bi-partite matching too. 

Tree: know at least one balanced bst. Applications of BST in problems. 

Use of Heaps, Hashmaps, Sets.


**********

These are the sample questions, you may find the same in Interviewbit as well..

Pl keep it very confedential...

Only for practice purpose

**********

1- Given an initial binary pattern and a goal binary pattern, and a collection of "safe " binary patterns, determine if there are exists a sequence of safe binary patterns that starts with the initial and ends with the goal.

2- Write code to implement auto- suggest as you type feature ( like Google search)

3- implement a client side cache

4- parallelization a computation on manu vectors. given a large number of vectors of different sizes, on each vector you have to perform the following computation.

V =a1,a2,a3,...an
Compute sum f(ai,aj) for all i, j and i<j

This has to be done on all the input vectors.
How can you parallelize this effectively.


5- Given m*n rooms grid, where few rooms are closed , few rooms are open and few rooms are open and have guards. Open rooms are connected by doors. For each room find minimum distance from the guard. 

6- (a) You are given a rooter tree. The grasshopper is originally at the root of the tree. At each point in ( discrete) time, the grasshopper randomly picks a child node and jumps there. If there are not any child nodes , the grasshopper is Trapped in the node forever.
A long time had passed since the grasshopper started its journey. For each node of the tree, calculate the probability of finding the grasshopper at that node.

6(b) The grasshopper was caught and put on a directed acyclic graph ( DAG). You are given the structure of the DAG , and the node of the grasshopper was initially put on.
A long time has planned since the grasshopper started its journey. For each node of the DAG, calculate the probability of finding the grasshopper at that node.

7 - Given a binary tree where each node knows the total count of its children, write FindNthNode (root, N) , where N is the node's index based on in- order traversal.

8- Given an infinite grid and a finite blocked walls ( co- ordinates) on the grid, find if it's possible to reach a given destination point for a person standing on a given source point. The co-ordinate of the walls , source point and the destination point are given as an input and person can move in all 8 directions.

********
You may find these questions easy but during interview, Interviewer puts more follow up and edge cases..

So you can create your own scenarios..
